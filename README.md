# scala-quality-template

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boldradius/scala-quality-template.svg
 "Build Status")    
    
This is a sample project configuration that incorporates all of the
flags, plugins and options that we've found useful when building
 a Scala project with high code quality.

Not all quality attributes of course can be captured through static analysis, but why not let the compiler do as much as it can...
